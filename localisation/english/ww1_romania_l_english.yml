While appointingn the fractured PNL would be unwise, there are some fears that Carp will drive the nation towards civil war.

Our efforts are sure to cause waves through future generations. Let the committee be organized, for a better Romania."

ROM_a_useful_ally:0 "A Useful Ally"
ROM_a_useful_ally_desc:0 "King Ferdinand is, for the moment, a liberal king. Nearly the opposite of his uncle, the past King Carol, Ferdinand believes in limited monarchy to the degree almost surprising. This also means he endorses the party elected by the people in a way his uncle never would have, allowing us to pass legislature we never could have before.

ROM_a_unifying_figure_head_desc:0 "It is high time for every man in this country to have the ability to vote.

ROM_from_the_top_down_desc:0 "The peasant class will do best when the economy does best. We need to continue industrialization, to create more low skill, medium pay factory jobs for the population. To do this, we should offer lucrative tax cuts to foreign companies wishing to invest in romania."

ROM_king_carols_reign:0 "King Carol's Reign"
ROM_king_carols_reign_desc:0 "While being a German himself, many consider King Carol the founding father of the Romanian state, and a Romanian in his own right. Under his rule we obtained independence from the Ottomans and are developing into a regional power.

ww1_romania.78.d:0 "The so-called swamp of Romanian politics, consisting of unelected appointed government positions, often in which jobs are given to friends and family, are opposing our governments campaign to help reduce corruption in government. Those in the PNL in particular are demanding protection from these efforts, and are threatening to oppose our government if we don't"
ww1_romania.78.a:0 "We can make some exceptions"
ww1_romania.78.b:0 "Who do they think they are?"
ww1_romania.18.d:0 "With the king losing faith in the current government, the current Prime Minister has been forced to resign. With the Prime Minister spot vacant, the king will now have to form a new government. The king has several different options available, and must pick the best one. Who shall be appointed to form the next government?"

ww1_romania.20.t:0 "The Left Boycotts Election for Bucharest Council"
ww1_romania.20.d:0 "As a way to protest the new conservative government, the PNL and some in the PCD have decided they will be boycotting the elections for Bucharest Council. By showing low turnout will end up being, they hope to prove that the people do not actually support the conservatives. They're free to do this, as it will just ensure we win the election. The conservatives are divided however, in many different factions. While the king appointed Carp's faction of the conservatives in power as Prime Minister, the people will have to pick which conservative faction wins this one.\n\nOne of the canidates aligns with Carp's more elitist, authoritarian group of conservatives. They believe vast reforms arn't needed for Romania, and that parliament has been given much more power then it really should have. The other canidate comes from the anti Carp faction of the conservatives. Generally younger, and more centrist, they believe Carp holds a threat to Romanian democracy and want greater reforms to Romanias economy."
ww1_romania.20.a:0 "The pro Carp faction wins!"
ww1_romania.20.b:0 "The 'Romanian Young-Turks' win!"
ww1_romania.18.t:0 "King Appoints New Government"
ww1_romania.17.d:0 "The recently announced Romanian elections have came to an end. With the votes being counted up, the PC has been announced the winner of the elections, securing a quite large electoral landslide. With this, we will finally have the mandate to pass out agenda. The Romanian people still expect reforms to continue, so we must be careful in our leadership. Failing to govern properly could lead to King Carol outright dismissing us!"
ww1_romania.77.t:0 "Which PC Faction Should We Appoint?"
ww1_romania.77.d:0 ""
ww1_romania.17.a:0 "Finally! Let's get to governing"
ww1_romania.16.t:0 "PC Accuses us of Corruption!"
ww1_romania.16.d:0 "Members of the PC have been intensifying their attacks on us as of lately, this time accusing us of favortism in the cabinet. They claim the PNL government has been giving unqualified members cabinet positions just for their loyalty, instead of their merit. These are mostly baseless, but they're hurting our support amongst the population. King Carol has also expressed his concern about the issue privately with Bratianu, stating their may be some truth in it and that the PNL needs to reform itself. "
ww1_romania.16.a:0 "It's lies and propaganda!"
ww1_romania.15.t:0 "Alliance with the NDP?"
ww1_romania.15.d:0 "With the PCD-PNL alliance announced, we have a chance to form our own electoral alliance. While the NDP isn't nearly as popular as the PCD, it does have its own small, yet loyal base of support. Additionally, alligning ourselves with the NDP will further symbolizes the PCD's shift towards the left economically. This could allow us to out-flank the PNL's economically left base, which would help us significantly.\n\nThe problem is, however, that the NDP could have its own baggade. The NDP is seen as very extreme by most of the country, and for good reason. The NDP has had its own history of using violence to gain political support, and some NDP members have... questionable takes on the Jewish community, to say the least. It would also anger King Carol, who already believes Carp may be too arogant and extreme to win an election."
ww1_romania.15.a:0 "We'll fight fire with fire!"
ww1_romania.15.b:0 "What do we have to gain from these fools?"
ww1_romania.14.t:0 "PNL Announces Alliance with the PCD"
ww1_romania.14.d:0 "With Carp rejecting the kings requests to reconcile the PCD, the PNL and PCD have announced an electoral coalition to oppose the PC. With this alliance, the tides have shifted against the PC and towards the PNL-PCD alliance. Although not ideal, we must remain confident about our chances next election. "
ww1_romania.14.a:0 "They're desperate, clearly!"
ww1_romania.13.t:0 "The Consensus of the Centre"
ww1_romania.13.d:0 "The recent formation of the PC-PCD alliance has given the coalition a significant boost in the polls. While at first many predicted the race as a complete-tossup, and some experts even seeing the election as leaning towards the PNL, the PC-PCD alliance has been gaining significant ground across the country. With the shift of the right towards the centre, peasants who were originally concerned the Conservatives would oppose new land reform have been softened, while many see the issues with the PNL and its corruption scandals."
ww1_romania.13.a:0 "Its time to turn a new leaf!"
ww1_romania.12.t:0 "Alexandru Marghiloman Proposes... Securing 'Election Security'"
ww1_romania.12.d:0 "While the conservatives are the incumbents, theres still a reformist mood across much of country. Many political experts are calling the race a complete tossup, with some even saying the election leans towards the PNL. Another PNL government would be unacceptable, to say the least. Seeing the situation, Minister of the Interior Alexandru Marghiloman has proposed to Carp a way to secure our victory: tampering with the election. While of course not... morally great, it would indeed secure a win."
ww1_romania.12.a:0 "What? Uh yeah, yeah that sounds great"
ww1_romania.12.b:0 "Have some confidence in us, Marghiloman!"
ww1_romania.11.t:0 "King Carol Requests We Mantain Previous PNL Land Reform"
ww1_romania.11.d:0 "While the most recent PNL land reform bill failed, the PNL has indeed passed many significant reforms since the 1907 revolt. With conservatives in power, some in the party, including Carp, believe repealing some of these reforms should be considered. King Carol obviously disagrees, being the one who appointed the liberals in the first place. Now that conservatives have came into power, Carol has quested Carp take the position many in the conservatives have taken as of late: fully endorse previous land reform, and promise not to overturn it. This, Carol claims, is needed to mantain stability and avoid another 1907. While Carp may disagree, its clear Carol feels strongly on this issue. Opposing him here may lead him to be significantly less confident in our government."
ww1_romania.11.a:0 "Letting the king dictate party policy would be a bad precedent"
ww1_romania.11.b:0 "Don't worry, we agree these measures are reasonable"
ww1_romania.10.t:0 "King Carol Requests Carp Reconcile the PCD"
ww1_romania.10.d:0 "The PCD - formally known as the Partidul Conservator-Democrat, and its rivarly with the PC is widely known. Originating as a splinter from the PC, the PCD claims to be the most moderate of the main 3 Romanian parties. Generally being economically moderate while socially conservative, the PCD rose to popularity after it splintered from the PC, having ran multiple governments themselves. Now, with the first conservative government in years, King Carol is urgent to ensure it remains stable. With the PCD and the PC agreeing on many things, as well as most of the PCD party leaders having history in the PC, Carol sees an opprotunity for the 2 parties to form a centre right government. While Carp himself is personally opposed to the idea, its welcomed by many moderates in the party. Ensuring Carol supports the government will also be crucial to its survival. Is angering Carol really worth it here?"
ww1_romania.10.a:0 "Respectfully your majesty, we'd be better without them"
ww1_romania.10.b:0 "Alright, lets form a coalition government"
ww1_romania.9.t:0 "Forming a New Government"
ww1_romania.17.t:0 "PC Majority Elected!"
ww1_romania.9.a:0 "Lets see how they do!"
ww1_romania.9.d:0 "With the failure to pass land reform, Prime Minister Brătianu has decided to resign in protest. With the king being tasked to form a new government, its been decided to give the conservative PC party a chance to govern. While being out of power for the last few years, the PC has gone through a dramatic shift. Going from a outright elitist party, the PC has seen the need to change and thus the party has rebranded itself, shifting to the left on a variety of issues including labor rights and the economy. While Carol has appointed the PC to rule, Carol is no tyrant. Thus, elections set to take place in 1911 have been announced."
ww1_romania.8.t:0 "The Carol Mosque"
ww1_romania.8.d:0 "While the Muslim population in Romania is small, they do have prominence. As a sign of respect and solidarity with Romanian Muslims, as well as an act of good will to the Ottoman Empire, King Carol today ordered construction to begin on a grand mosque in Constanta, one of our largest cities. While construction will be slow, the ambitious project will certainly increase tourism to our country once completed."
ww1_romania.8.a:0 "We're an inclusive country!"
ww1_romania.1.t:0 "The Puppet Master"
ww1_romania.28.t:0 "The Outbreak of the Great War"
ww1_romania.28.d:0 "The Central Powers vs the Entente, it's the biggest war in human history. With our key position in Europe, there's lots of focus towards us, and what we will do. While a lot of our population is either pro Entente or pro neutrality, we currently have a defensive pact with the Central Powers. While we aren't legally under any obligation to join the war, German and Austrian diplomats have been heavily pressuring our country to join their side as of late, promising vast Russian territories.\n\nIt's unknown if our army is truely ready for a war yet, but joining Germany now could be our best chance to quickly secure our desired territory in Russia while Russia finds itself unprepared. On the otherhand, it may be safer and more practical to simply wait it out, and see how the war progresses. What's the plan?"
ww1_romania.28.a:0 "We're not ready to take any drastic options here, let's stay neutral for now"

ww1_romania.80.t:0 "The Carp Constitution"
ww1_romania.1.d:0 "The Romanian constitution of 1866 has often been praised as one of the most modern constitutions in the world at the time, with separation of powers, an abolished death penalty, guaranteed private property, freedom of speech, and total freedom of the press. However, the Romanian constitution has changed very little since then, and thus Romania has fallen from one of the most democratic countries at its time, to the flawed constitutional monarchy it is now.\n\nWhether this is a positive or negative development for Romania is debatable, but one thing can be agreed upon by everyone: King Carol's influence on the Romanian political system is immense, and has grown in recent times. King Carol has often simply rotated between forming a government with the liberal PNL, and the conservative PC, as well as the recently formed moderate PCD. This has lead to little actual reform in Romania, as opposing political parties overturn much of the reforms the last government passed. This culminated in a revolt by angry peasants in 1907, angered by the little reform passed by any government. Thus, King Carol has taken a new course, appointing a liberal government that has governed the country for the last 3 years straight, passing a suprisingly large amount of reforms as of recent, which has kept the peasants in line for now.\n\nWith the 1911 elections approaching, King Carols confidence in the liberals and their ability to govern has declined. Seeing it as time for a new party to get a chance to rule Romania, King Carol has been flirting with the idea of appoiting a conservative government, or at least supporting the conservatives in the elections."
ww1_romania.1.a:0 "The King is a very wise man"
ww1_romania.88.t:0 "Petre Carp Forms Government in Romania"
ww1_romania.88.d:0 "With the results of Romanias recent elections in, Petre Carp's conservative party has captured a majority in parliament. Thus, King Carol has given them the task of forming a government. Notably, Petre Carp has long been a Germophile and has written several works calling for the 'liberation' of Moldova from the Russian Empire. With this, many are expecting Romania to draw closer to Germany. Even more concerningly for the entente, Carp has shown authoritarian tendencies in the past and in his current rhetoric, and thus it's unknown if Carp would be willing to give up power."
ww1_romania.88.a:0 "Is he a threat to Romanian democracy?"
ww1_romania.88.b:0 "Lets hope his government falls!"
ww1_romania.88.c:0 "We wish him well!"
ww1_romania.89.t:0 "PNL Government in Romania"
ww1_romania.89.d:0 "Today the King tasked the liberal PNL party of Romania to form a new government. Notably, many in the PNL are outspoken Francophiles, and thus many expect this new government may draw closer to the Entente. This would prove a big blow to the Central Powers, which has heavily influenced Romania in the past. Already, the new government has began outreach to France, and suprisingly, Russia, to strengthen ties. Although nothing is guaranteed, this seems to be a big blow to Germany."
ww1_romania.89.a:0 "It would certainly shake things up"
ww1_romania.89.b:0 "Great!"
ww1_romania.89.c:0 "Nothing is guarenteed!"

ww1_romania.2.t:0 "The Brătianu Land Reform Bill - Debate Begins"
ww1_romania.5.a:0 "What a disaster!"

With the appointment of Titu Maiorescu, coalitions are shifting once again.\nWith Maiorescu's focus on rural issues, those who have often felt ignored by the elitist conservative PC have began to rethink their future votes. Although not a liberal, Maiorescu has unorthodox views on land reform for a conservative, which has helped shift the rural areas towards the PC.
